Hi Beshad. I just want to say how grateful I am to be in your class. I have learned heaps especially from someone coming from a non-IT background. I hope to be able to hone my skill in web development and transition to a career in tech.

Also, in regard to my contact.html file. I tried to validate it using the validator.w3 but it's always giving me this error "the value of the "label for" attribute of the "label" element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control. I followed everything from our last lesson but I can't seem to fix it. Can you please let me know if this make a huge dent on my grade? 

Again, thank you so much for all your help :)
